    // A template class for converting a series of text records into a
    // bucketed binary in-memory structure for quick easy access.
    //
    // Exception Safety:
    // The Basic guarantee is provided.
    //
    // Copy Behavior:
    // Copying is allowed.
    //
    //
    // Assumptions:
    // - bucket IDs start at 1.
    // - records are sorted by bucket ID smallest to largest.
    //
