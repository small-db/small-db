(ns jepsen.fs-cache
  "Some systems Jepsen tests are expensive or time-consuming to set up. They
  might involve lengthy compilation processes, large packages which take a long
  time to download, or allocate large files on initial startup.

  Other systems require state which persists from run to run--for instance,
  there might be an expensive initial cluster join process, and you might want
  to perform that process once, save the cluster's state to disk before
  testing, and for subsequent tests redeploy that state to nodes to skip the
  cluster join.

  This namespace provides a persistent cache, stored on the control node's
  filesystem, which is suitable for strings, data, or files. It also provides a
  basic locking mechanism.

  Cached values are referred to by logical *paths*: a vector of strings,
  keywords, numbers, booleans, etc; see the Encode protocol for details. For
  instance, a cache path could be any of

    [:hi]
    [1 true]
    [:foodb :license :key]
    [:foodb \"1523a6b\"]

  Cached paths can be stored and retrieved in several ways. Each storage type
  has a pair of functions: (cache/save-string! path \"foo\") writes \"foo\" to
  `path`, and (cache/load-string path) returns the stored value as a string.

  - As strings (save-string!, load-string)
  - As EDN data (save-edn!, load-edn)
  - As raw File objects (save-file!, load-file)
  - As remote files (save-remote!, deploy-remote!)

  In general, writers are `(save-format! from-source to-path)`, and return
  `from-source`, allowing them to be used transparently for side effects.
  Readers are `(load-format path)`, and return `nil` if the value is uncached.
  You can use `(cached? path)` to distinguish between a missing cache value and
  a present `nil`.

  Writes to cache are atomic: a temporary file will be written to first, then
  renamed into its final cache location.

  You can acquire locks on any cache path, whether it exists or not, using
  `(locking path ...)`."
