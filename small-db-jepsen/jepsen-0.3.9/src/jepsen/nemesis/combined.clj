(ns jepsen.nemesis.combined
  "A nemesis which combines common operations on nodes and processes: clock
  skew, crashes, pauses, and partitions. So far, writing these sorts of nemeses
  has involved lots of special cases. I expect that the API for specifying
  these nemeses is going to fluctuate as we figure out how to integrate those
  special cases appropriately. Consider this API unstable.

  This namespace introduces a new abstraction. A `nemesis+generator` is a map
  with a nemesis and a generator for that nemesis. This enables us to write an
  algebra for composing both simultaneously. We call
  checkers+generators+clients a \"workload\", but I don't have a good word for
  this except \"nemesis\". If you can think of a good word, please let me know.

  We also take advantage of the Process and Pause protocols in jepsen.db,
  which allow us to start, kill, pause, and resume processes."

       :file \"path/to/file/or/dir\"
       :drop {:distribution :geometric :p 1e-3}}]}}
   ```

   `:type` can be `:bitflip` or `:truncate`.

   If `:file` is a directory, a new random file is selected from that directory
  on each target node for each operation.

   `:probability` or `:drop` can be specified as a single value or a
  `distribution-map`. Use a `distribution-map` to generate a new random value
  for each operation using [[jepsen.util/rand-distribution]].

   See [[jepsen.nemesis/bitflip]] and [[jepsen.nemesis/truncate-file]].

   Additional options as for [[nemesis-package]]."

  graphs.

  This nemesis is intended for throwing a broad array of simple failures at the
  wall, and seeing \"what sticks\". Once you've found a fault, you can restrict
  the failure modes to specific types of faults, and specific targets for those
  faults, to try and reproduce it faster.

  This nemesis is *not* intended for complex sequences of faults, like
  partitionining away a leader, flipping some switch, adjusting the clock on an
  unrelated node, then crashing someone else. I don't think I can devise a good
  declarative langauge for that in a way which is simpler than \"generators\"
  themselves. For those types of faults, you'll write your own generator
  instead, but you may be able to use this *nemesis* to execute some or all of
  those operations.

  Mandatory options:

    :db         The database you'd like to act on

  Optional options:

    :interval   The interval between operations, in seconds.
    :faults     A collection of enabled faults, e.g. [:partition, :kill, ...]
    :partition  Controls network partitions
    :packet     Controls network packet behavior
    :kill       Controls process kills
    :pause      Controls process pauses and restarts
    :file-corruption Controls file corruption

  Possible faults:

    :partition
    :packet
    :kill
    :pause
    :clock
    :file-corruption

  Partition options:

    :targets    A collection of partition specs, e.g. [:majorities-ring, ...]

  Packet options:

    :targets    A collection of node specs, e.g. [:one, :all]
    :behaviors  A collection of network packet behaviors, e.g. [{:delay {}}]

  Kill and Pause options:

    :targets    A collection of node specs, e.g. [:one, :all]

  File corruption options:

    :targets     A collection of node specs, e.g. [:one, :all]
    :corruptions A collection of file corruptions, e.g. [{:type :bitflip, :file \"/path/to/file\" :probability 1e-3}]"
