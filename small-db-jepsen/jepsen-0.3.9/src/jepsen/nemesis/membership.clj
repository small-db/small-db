(ns jepsen.nemesis.membership
  "EXPERIMENTAL: provides standardized support for nemeses which add and remove
  nodes from a cluster.

  This is a tricky problem. Even the concept of cluster state is complicated:
  there is Jepsen's knowledge of the state, and each individual node's
  understanding of the current state. Depending on which node you ask, you may
  get more or less recent (or, frequently, divergent) views of cluster state.
  Cluster state representation is highly variable across databases, which means
  our standardized state machine must allow for that variability.

  We are guided by some principles that crop up repeatedly in writing these
  sorts of nemeses:

  1. We should avoid creating useless cluster states--e.g. those that can't
     fulfill any requests--for very long.

  2. There are both safe and unsafe transitions. In general, commands like
     join/remove should always be safe. Removing data, however, is *unsafe*
     unless we can prove the node has been properly removed.

  3. We *want* to leave nodes running, with data files intact, after removing
     them. This is when interesting things happen.

  4. We must be safe in the presence of concurrent node kill/restart
     operations.

  5. Nodes tend to go down or fail to reach the rest of the cluster, but we
     want to continue making decisions during this time.

  6. Requested changes to the cluster may time out, or simply take a while to
     perform. We need to *remember* these ongoing operations, use them to
     constrain our choices of further changes (e.g. if four node removals are
     underway, don't initiate a fifth), and find ways to resolve those ongoing
     changes, e.g. by confirming they took place.

  Our general approach is to define a sort of state machine where the state is
  our representation of the cluster state, how all nodes view the cluster, and
  the set of ongoing operations, plus any auxiliary material (e.g. after
  completing a node removal, we can delete its data files). This state is
  periodically *updated* by querying individual nodes, and *also* by performing
  operations--e.g. initiating a node removal.

  The generator constructs those operations by asking the nemesis what sorts of
  operations would be legal to perform at this time, and picking one of those.
  It then passes that operation back to the nemesis (via nemesis/invoke!), and
  the nemesis updates its local state and performs the operation."
