(ns jepsen.core
  "Entry point for all Jepsen tests. Coordinates the setup of servers, running
  tests, creating and resolving failures, and interpreting results.

  Jepsen tests a system by running a set of singlethreaded *processes*, each
  representing a single client in the system, and a special *nemesis* process,
  which induces failures across the cluster. Processes choose operations to
  perform based on a *generator*. Each process uses a *client* to apply the
  operation to the distributed system, and records the invocation and
  completion of that operation in the *history* for the test. When the test is
  complete, a *checker* analyzes the history to see if it made sense.

  Jepsen automates the setup and teardown of the environment and distributed
  system by using an *OS* and *client* respectively. See `run!` for details."

  2. Try to teardown, then setup the database
    - If the DB supports the Primary protocol, also perform the Primary setup
      on the first node.

  3. Create the nemesis

  4. Fork the client into one client for each node

  5. Fork a thread for each client, each of which requests operations from
     the generator until the generator returns nil
    - Each operation is appended to the operation history
    - The client executes the operation and returns a vector of history elements
      - which are appended to the operation history

  6. Capture log files

  7. Teardown the database

  8. Teardown the operating system

  9. When the generator is finished, invoke the checker with the history
    - This generates the final report"
